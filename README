=== What's FMEngine? ===

FMEngine is an open-source Objective-C framework for the last.fm API. You can use it in your iPhone and Mac OS X applications.
The source is released under the terms of the MIT License. The full license text can be found in the file LICENSE. 

FMEngine does *not* parse the output of the last.fm API (BYOP - Bring your own parser). It returns an NSData object that contains either XML or JSON output. Therefore it handles authentication, parameter signing, etc.

It's in a very early alpha stage and there's still a lot to do, but hey, it's working!
